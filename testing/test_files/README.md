These files are based on WHDLoad install "TemplosSagradosHD", which seems to be freely distibutable. As such, it is in my honest belief that these files can be used to create and distribute a test bench
Original source: http://whdload.de/games/TemplosSagrados.lha

Some attributes have been changed, filenotes added as well as some extra files/directories for the test.
